Hi there, my name is April Qu. I am a recent business graduate with a concentration in marketing and a minor in psychology from Wilfrid Laurier University. I am a highly-organized, friendly and resourceful individual with over 1 year of office experience in administration and marketing.  
	<br> <br> I lived a year abroad and spent 6 months backpacking and volunteering across Europe. I am highly personable, multilingual in Mandarin and French, and love meeting new people. I am proficient in the Microsoft Office Suite and Google docs, and have a basic understanding of HTML/CSS (now able to make my own webpage). My passions include travelling, discovering different cultures and food, and constantly learning new things.

	<p><br> Hi there,<br> <br>

I am excited to be applying for the role of Student Success Coordinator at BrainStation. I’ve been a fan of BrainStation ever since I attended an evening workshop called Intro to Instagram Marketing. I had an incredible learning experience and would love to be a contributing part of the community. As a business administration graduate from Wilfrid Laurier University with over 1+ years of professional work experience in administration and marketing, superb organizational skills, and a passion for education, I believe I can make a positive impact to your team.  <br><br>

You specified that you are looking for someone who has excellent communication and organizational skills. As a business administration graduate, I have honed these skillsets for over 4 years in order to complete numerous business projects and group assignments and can apply these skills to the coordinator role at BrainStation. In addition, working as a business intern at Deloitte has given me the skills necessary to perform various tasks required of a coordinator. I gained experience reviewing and proofreading documents, using MS Excel and PowerPoint programs, and booking and scheduling meetings. I also created a slide deck of my duties and tasks in order to help the transition of the next incoming intern. I carried these tasks out in a positive and organized manner and I will be able to apply these abilities to this position.  <br><br> 

I have always been a passionate advocate for improving education. During university, I was an exam aid instructor with a campus organization called Students Offering Support where I tutored students in a psychology course to raise money to fund educational projects in Latin America. We taught over a hundred students and I acted as a primary point of contact, assisting students with questions and utilizing their feedback to improve each tutoring session. We raised $2000 by the end of the semester, making it one of the most successful course exam aid sessions. I also lived abroad for one year in Europe and I spent a substantial amount of time volunteering where adapting and learning quickly was essential. From connecting with visitors at hostels to providing a welcome community environment at yoga retreats, these experiences have developed my interpersonal and problem-solving skills in dealing with unexpected issues and engaging with diverse groups of people. 

<br><br> I constantly strive to improve myself and the organizations that I am a member of, a dedication that will come with me to the workplace. I believe my excellent organizational skills, work experiences, and passion for education make me an excellent candidate to support BrainStation and its community. Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon, 
<br><br><br>
Warm Regards, <br><br><br>
April Qu
